The Decision Tree building project for WEKA and Connect 4. (Sean MacEachern and Zach Arnold)


To use this project, you need to make sure that the command line CSV file arguments are in the same directory as the program. If not, 
you will need to provide the fully qualified path to the file on the command line.

Example:

./myprogram in.csv out.csv <--these two files need to be in the same directory!!
